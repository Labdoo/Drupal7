* Introduction: Labdoo Modules

  Labdoo features are generally implemented via modules, which act as standalone
  building blocks. This document describes how to create a Labdoo module.

* Steps to Create a Labdoo Module

  - Create a new folder under the path lbd/profiles/labdoo/modules/custom/

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd /var/www/lbd/profiles/labdoo/modules/custom/
    mkdir lbd_mymodule
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    (Change the keyword mymodule for a word reflecting the functionality of your module)

  - Create your code inside the folder lbd_mymodule following the standard
    process of building modules in Drupal. That is, create at least the files 
    lbd_mymodule.info and lbd_mymodule.module plus any additional files needed
    to support your module.

  - Make sure to document correctly your code. Don't forget to include the clauses
    @defgroup, @file and @ingroup and make sure that each function is properly
    documented following the Drupal standard. (E.g., make sure to use the clauses 
    @param and @return.) This is important to ensure that 
    documentation of the code can be properly and automatically generated.
    For an example of how the code should be documented, see for instance
    the Dootrip module (lbd_dootrip).

  - If your module requires other modules, make sure to include the proper dependencies
    in the following files:

      + Add dependencies[] clauses in the file lbd_mymodule.info
      + Add projects[] clauses in the file lbd/profiles/labdoo/labdoo.make if they are not there yet

  - Finally, if you want your module to be enabled by default upon building Labdoo, then: 

      + Add a dependencies[] clause in the file lbd/profiles/labdoo/labdoo.info
