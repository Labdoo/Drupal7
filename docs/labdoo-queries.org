** SQL Queries

The following are some of the most commonly used SQL queries.

  - To get the list of countries where Labdoo is working do as follows (the list is ordered according to the time at which a country was added to Labdoo.org):

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mysql> SELECT DISTINCT country FROM location WHERE lid IN (SELECT lid FROM location_instance WHERE nid!=0 ORDER by nid);
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To get the same list for cities instead of countries:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mysql> SELECT DISTINCT city FROM location WHERE lid IN (SELECT lid FROM location_instance WHERE nid!=0 ORDER by nid);
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To get the number of users per country: 

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mysql> select count(*) from location_instance where uid!=0;
    mysql> SELECT country,FLOOR(COUNT(*)*TOTAL_NUM_USERS/RESULT_OF_PREVIOUS_QUERY) AS cnt FROM location WHERE lid IN (SELECT lid FROM location_instance where uid!=0) GROUP BY country ORDER BY cnt DESC;
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To see the current status of the visualization cache:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mysql> SELECT cid FROM cache WHERE cid LIKE '%lbd_visualization%';
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To see outstanding newsletters:
   
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mysql> select * from simplenews_newsletter;
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To stop sending a newsletter or to allow to resend an already sent newsletter:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mysql> update simplenews_newsletter set status=0 where nid=20510; # change 20510 for the nid of the newsletter 
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - Dootronics performance for a given year:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    mysql> SELECT AVG(field_cpu_value) FROM field_data_field_cpu WHERE entity_id IN (SELECT nid FROM node WHERE YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(created))=2016);
    mysql> SELECT AVG(field_memory_value) FROM field_data_field_memory WHERE entity_id IN (SELECT nid FROM node WHERE YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(created))=2016);
    mysql> SELECT AVG(field_hard_drive_value) FROM field_data_field_hard_drive WHERE entity_id IN (SELECT nid FROM node WHERE YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(created))=2016);
    mysql> SELECT AVG(field_battery_duration_value) FROM field_data_field_battery_duration WHERE entity_id IN (SELECT nid FROM node WHERE YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(created))=2016);
    #+END_EXAMPLE


** Drush Queries

The following are some of the most commonly used drush queries.

  - To delete the visualization cache:
 
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # drush php-eval "cache_clear_all('lbd_visualization', 'cache', TRUE);"
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To check the status of the lbd_communicate email batches:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # drush php-eval "print_r(cache_get('cachedEmailParametersArray'));" 
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To remove the top email batch set from the cache:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # drush php-eval "lbd_communicate_pop_email_cache(0);" # pops the top element
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  - To update the Labdoo logo (the small logo located at the upper left part of each Labdoo page):

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # Modify first the png file in lbd-set-logo.php to point to the new logo file, then run:
    # drush @lbd php-script /var/www/lbd/profiles/labdoo/utils/lbd-set-logo.php 
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** Bash commands

The following bash commands can come handy:

  - To create a compressed tar ball with all the Labdoo pictures:
  
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # find /var/www/lbd/sites/* -name *jpg | tar zcf labdoo-pictures.tar.gz -T -   
    #+END_EXAMPLE
