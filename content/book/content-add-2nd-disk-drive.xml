<value>If the installed hard disk becomes too small and the computer allows the installation of a 2nd disk, you can configure such 2nd disk to mount automatically during booting time. To do so you have to: 

<ul>
<li>
Press ALT+CTRL+T at the same time to start a terminal, and type the following command to initiate the file manager in superuser mode: <code>sudo pcmanfm &amp;</code> (enter).
</li>
<li>
Navigate to the folder /mnt and create inside it a new folder with the name of the 2nd disk.
</li>
<li>
Get the UUID (ID of the disk-drive) of the 2nd disk by typing the command <code>sudo blkid</code>, search for your 2nd drive in the list and write down its UUID.
</li>
<li>
Type the following command to edit the fstab file: <code>sudo nano /etc/fstab</code> [Enter]
</li>
<li>
Add at the end of the fstab file a new line as follows (in one single line): 
<code>UUID=[add here the UUID of the 2nd disk you wrote down above]
/mnt/[add here the name of the 2nd disk folder you created above] auto defaults 0 0</code> 
(Make sure to leave a space character between each entry)
Leave the file editor by pressing CTRL+X then Y (to save) and [Enter].
</li>
<li>
Optionally, to allow access for all users to your 2nd disk do as follows: Open your file manager in superuser mode again <code>sudo pcmanfm &amp;</code>, go to your 2nd disk folder and right click on it with your mouse. Under properties, select "Access rights for others", check the "Allow create or delete new files / folders",  and then "Apply to all folders".
</li>
</ul>

Re-boot your computer. The new disk should be automatically mounted.</value>
