<value><strong>Collecting laptops from your local community</strong>

There exist several strategies to collect unused laptops from your local community, but in all of them, the main idea is to outreach to your network of friends, relatives, coworkers, classmates, etc. to help bring awareness about your laptop drive activities. Many of the people you know have unused laptops sitting idle and the objective is to give them an option to repurpose their unused laptops for a humanitarian/education cause. Some ideas to help you collect laptops are:

<ul>
<li>
If you are a student or a teacher in a school, you can write a letter to the parents of the students asking for unused laptops. Many parents work for companies who have unused laptops.
</li>
<li>
Use your social network skills and tools to bring awareness. Write a post on your favorite social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc.) letting people know about your laptop collection activities.
</li>
<li>
You can also be creative and come up with your laptop collection strategy. You will find tools to help organize your local campaigns inside the <a href="/sites/default/files/content/labdoo-tolkit/packaging.png">Labdoo Toolkit</a>.
