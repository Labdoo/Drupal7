<value><strong> User</strong>

Each laptop (cloned or installed using install-scripts) comes with 3 users:
<ul>
<li><strong>labdoo</strong>: has super user rights / is administrator! The log-in password is <strong>labdoo</strong> (Please change this password when logging in the first time, as the user <strong>labdoo</strong> is administrator and may destroy the system! So only teacher should know the password of the user labdoo)</li>

<li><strong>student</strong>: is the standard user for the students. His password is also <strong>labdoo></strong> (it's up to you, if you change the password for student)</li>

<li><strong>guest</strong>: needs no password, but all his entries will be aber es werden alle seine Eingaben und Änderungen nach der Abmeldung gelöscht</li>
</ul>

<strong>To change the password</strong> → System Tools → users and groups → +Add (to add a new user) or change → password „labdoo“ → change it → ok 

Manage Groups → to manage, if a user belongs to a certain group (e.g. group labdoo)

<strong>To a program</strong>

Start e.g. using an educational program. There are a lot of interesting, funny and educational tools and games. And so you start:

Click in the left lower corner on the Lubuntu icon (similar to Windows XP) →  “Education” or „game“ → click on a program to start it

In the folder of „/Public“ you will find a lot of useful manuals, OER, Offline wikis, e-books etc. 

On the desktop you will a video tutorial and the Offline wiki tool Xowa. 

<strong>Optional: Desktops (user interfaces)</strong>

A Labdoo laptop comes with Lubuntu (Linux operating system based on Ubuntu and the LXDE desktop). LXDE is an easy to learn user interface, lean, fastl. LXDE / Lubuntu can be installed on older laptops, from 256 / 512 MB RAM.

Optional you are able to install other desktops, but they ask for more hardware resources -

<ul>
<li>Unity: fast hardware needed (min 1 GB RAM)</li>
<li>Gnome: medium to fast hardware needed (756 MB - 1 GB RAM)</li>
</ul>

<strong>language, regional formats and keyboard settings (please adjust when online)</strong>

Depending on the country of the edoovillage you may want to install one or more additional language(s) or keyboard(s).

Click Preferences → Language Support. Sometimes you get the message “Language support not completely installed, install now” → confirm by "Yes" and install.

In the next window click → Install/Remove languages → select the language(s) needed → Apply → Apply System-wide.

The new languages will show up in the language list above: Lubuntu first tries to find a word in this table in language no. 1, next in language no. 2 and so on, and will stop using English.

To change priority of the languages → mark the new language → right mouse click on new language, keep on pressing right mouse button → move the language to its position, drop it → click  Apply System-wide. The new language will be used after logout and login or reboot of the computer.

<strong>Regional formats</strong>

You can also adjust the local currency, notation of numbers, date and time (if available). Click tab „Regional formats“ and select format in the list shown → Apply System-Wide. 

<strong>keyboard settings</strong>

If the laptop was cloned using images you can go ahead. Otherwise you have to add a panel item to the task bar → right mouse click on the task bar → Add / Remove Panel Items → +Add → select "Keyboard Layout Handler" → +Add → optional: move the item position within the task bar by Up or Down.

Right mouse click on the symbol "de" (keyboard layout handler) in the task bar (or another country abreviation shown) → Keyboard Layout handler Settings → Remove the hook "Keep system layout", if activated (otherwise you are not able to add new layouts) → 

+Add → Add a new keyboard layout
-Remove → Remove a  keyboard layout
up → Move a keyboard layout entry in the list up

The number of keyboard layout entries is limited to 4 (four). 

Have fun playing in learning with your Labdoo laptop!
