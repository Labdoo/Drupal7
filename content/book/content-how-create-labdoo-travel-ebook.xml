<value>Step 1. Print out the <a href = "http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/Public/eBooks/Labdoo%20Travel%20eBooks/drawing-paper-template.png" >“drawing-paper-template.png” </a> (in landscape paper orientation) for students to draw on.   
Step 2. Have each student verbally describes his/her favorite place (or food) and ask him/her why he/she likes it.
Step 3.  Ask the student to fill the title/name areas of the template page.
Step 4. While the memory is still fresh, ask the student to use the lines area of the drawing template to write down what he just described about the food/place in his native language, preferably 3-5 sentences.
Step 5. Have the student draws inside the blank box on the left to illustrate the paragraph he/she just wrote.
Step 6. Help the student translate his paragraph into English if the native language used is not English.
Step 7. Send us the drawings you've collected from the students, together with the <a href="http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/Public/eBooks/Labdoo%20Travel%20eBooks/eBook%20_ConsentToPublish.pdf"> Consent to Publish Form </a>, and we are happy to put them together as an eBook for your school.

Tip 1: Have the student draw in pencil first and then color it if time is allowed.
Tip 2: The student can use the back of the template page to write more if more space is needed.
