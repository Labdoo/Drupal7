<value>You have to remove and delete all data from hard disc. It is a very important part of the Labdoo project to make sure that all data is removed by overwritting the data with random data. 

In Linux systems the disc drives get letters, e.g. the 1st disc = sda, the 2nd disc = sdb etc. sda1, sda2 are partitions within disc sda.

Parted Magic offers you two solutions for a secure data deletion:

- in a terminal: open a terminal and type:

<strong><code>sudo shred /dev/sda -v -f</code></strong> (Enter) This will start to overwrite 3-times the disc drive by random data.

- As an alternative there is the tool <strong>Disk Eraser</strong> on the desktop. 

Click on the icon to start this tool, offering various options.
 
To delete the disc may last 1 - 2,5 hours, depending on CPU and disc size.

<strong>Hint:</strong> Please start the partition manager (see PM desktop) and check, if there are more than one disc installed. If so, please repeat the procedure alos for sdb, sdc etc.
You can delete various discs in parallel to save time.

Once the disc(s) were deleted you can upload the images.</value>
