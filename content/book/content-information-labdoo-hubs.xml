<value>Labdoo is a global collaborative platform that operates in a decentralized and flat structure. It is important to ensure a sustainable and organic growth, since hierarchies tend to generate bottlenecks and add unnecessary management overheads. This means that when it comes to taking action  to help bring education to children and reduce electronic waste, everyone can participate... the young, the adults or the elderly, from anywhere and even if you only have 5 minutes or a few hours of spare time.

In its simplest way, you can participate as an individual (e.g., sanitizing your own laptop once you no longer use it) as part of the grassroots process. All contributions you make as an individual will go to a default hub called <a href="/content/grassroots-0">the Grassroots Hub</a>. But if you decide that you want to unite forces with friends and accomplish more, you can create your own hub. As part of a hub, you will have some additional tools that will help you manage your inventory and increase your presence within the platform to better outreach local and global communities.

Here are the tools you receive when you create your own hub:

<ul>
<li><strong>Your own hub page.</strong> This page provides information (such as the location of your hub) to help donors know where they can bring their unused dootronics. From this page, you can also manage your own inventory of dootronics and edoovillages. 
</li>
<li><strong>Photo album.</strong> Every hub has its own photo album where hub managers can upload pictures of their own Labdoo activities. To access the album, click on the "Go to photo album" button found in the hub page.
</li>
<li><strong>Special rights.</strong> As a hub manager, your user account will be given additional management rights within the Labdoo platform, such as the rights to edit your hub information or the rights to create your own edoovillages.
</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<em> Figure. Every hub has its own page to help outreach the local community and manage its own inventory. Each page has access to open data including the list of dootronics, edoovillages, and progress metrics.</em>

As a hub you can choose to do any of the following activities.  A best practice is to start with one or two activities first, and then progressively increase as you gain experience.  In any case, you decide which activities you can carry out depending on your resources, preferences and availability.
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Collect and tag laptops.</strong> Collect unused laptops from your local community and maintain your own laptop inventory.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Quality Assurance.</strong> Get together with friends and members of your hub, sanitize unused laptops, install Ubuntu and the education software, and package dootronics ready to go on a new mini-mission.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Outreach your community.</strong> Let people know about the digital divide and eWaste problems, and mobilize people to help the Labdoo cause.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Recycle Laptops.</strong> Recycle laptops that no longer work and help reduce eWaste.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Dootrips.</strong> Organize your own dootrips by mobilizing travelers in your own area.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Create edoovillages.</strong> Identify schools that need laptops and set up new edoovillage projects with them.
</li>
