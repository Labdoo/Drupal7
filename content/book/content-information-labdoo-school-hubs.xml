<value><strong> Labdoo School Hubs </strong>

Thank you for your interest in forming a Labdoo School Hub. We appreciate your desire to help us spread awareness in your local community. Labdoo School Hubs is a special case of Labdoo Hubs in which the Hub is run by students in a school (for instance, students in high school). Notice that not all Hubs are school hubs, since hubs can also be implemented in many other places (at your home, at your work, as part of your NGO work, etc.). This section is dedicated to information about Labdoo School Hubs.

Please read the following documents carefully. This information will help you make the best decision during the process.
