<value>When sanitizing a computer, the minimum requirement is to install (1) the Lubuntu operating system, (2) the Edubuntu Education Package and (3) the Office Suite (Libre office). The Edubuntu package is a powerful education suite containing very valuable applications for children of all ages and for many areas of science. In addition to this package and optionally, you can also add even more education packages to your computer by installing some more software applications following the steps described in the next sections. 

Notice that if you sanitize your computer following the advanced method, the images you install already include these additional education packages, so you don't need to do anything else. However, if you sanitized the computer using the simple method, the following sections will guide you through the process of manually installing the additional education packages. Remember that these are optional packages, so you can decide to install all, some or none.
