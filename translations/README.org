+ Right click on the button "Raw", select the option 'Save link as' and download the file into your local computer.

+ Unzip the file using your favorite unzip application. This will extract various files.

+ For each file extracted, open it using a text editor and translate it to your language. 

+ Save the file using the same file name but changing its suffix to reflect the language you are translating to. For instance, if you are translating to Japanese the file 'dootrip_added_body-en.email', rename the translated file to 'dootrip_added_body-japanese.email'.
